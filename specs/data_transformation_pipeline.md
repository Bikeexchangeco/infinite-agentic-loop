# Data Transformation Pipeline Specification

## Core Challenge
Create a **data transformation pipeline** that cleans, analyzes, and manipulates data through multiple stages, producing valuable insights and high-quality outputs. Each iteration should explore different methodologies, algorithms, and visualization techniques to extract maximum value from the data.
