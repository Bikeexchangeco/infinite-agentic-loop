**INFINITE AGENTIC LOOP COMMAND**

Think deeply about this infinite generation task. You are about to embark on a sophisticated iterative creation process.

**Variables:**

spec_file: $ARGUMENTS
output_dir: $ARGUMENTS
count: $ARGUMENTS

**ARGUMENTS PARSING:**
Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. `spec_file` - Path to the markdown specification file
2. `output_dir` - Directory where iterations will be saved  
3. `count` - Number of iterations (1-N or "infinite")

**PHASE 1: SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS**
Read and deeply understand the specification file at `spec_file`. This file defines:
- What type of content to generate
- The format and structure requirements
- Any specific parameters or constraints
- The intended evolution pattern between iterations

Think carefully about the spec's intent and how each iteration should build upon previous work.

**PHASE 2: OUTPUT DIRECTORY RECONNAISSANCE** 
Thoroughly analyze the `output_dir` to understand the current state:
- List all existing files and their naming patterns
- Identify the highest iteration number currently present
- Analyze the content evolution across existing iterations
- Understand the trajectory of previous generations
- Determine what gaps or opportunities exist for new iterations

**PHASE 3: ITERATION STRATEGY**
Based on the spec analysis and existing iterations:
- Determine the starting iteration number (highest existing + 1)
- Plan how each new iteration will be unique and evolutionary
- Consider how to build upon previous iterations while maintaining novelty
- If count is "infinite", prepare for continuous generation until context limits

**PHASE 4: GENERATION EXECUTION**
For each iteration to generate:

1. **Deep Context Analysis**: Review the spec requirements and all previous iterations
2. **Evolutionary Planning**: Plan how this iteration will advance beyond previous ones
3. **Unique Content Creation**: Generate content that fulfills the spec while being distinctly new
4. **Quality Validation**: Ensure the output meets spec requirements and adds value
5. **File Naming**: Use the pattern specified in the spec with proper iteration suffixing

**PHASE 5: INFINITE MODE HANDLING**
If count is "infinite":
- Continue generating iterations until you approach context window limits
- Monitor your remaining context capacity
- Each iteration should become progressively more sophisticated
- Maintain awareness of when to gracefully conclude the generation cycle
- Provide a summary of all iterations created in the infinite run

**EXECUTION PRINCIPLES:**
- Each iteration must be genuinely unique and valuable
- Build upon previous work while introducing novel elements
- Maintain consistency with the original specification
- Ensure proper file organization and naming
- Think deeply about the evolution trajectory
- For infinite mode, optimize for maximum valuable output before context exhaustion

**ULTRA-THINKING DIRECTIVE:**
Before beginning generation, engage in extended thinking about:
- The deeper implications of the specification
- How to create meaningful progression across iterations  
- What makes each iteration valuable and unique
- The optimal strategy for infinite generation
- How to balance consistency with innovation

Begin execution with deep analysis and proceed systematically through each phase.
